<p>For Project 2 I decided to continue my original theme of using my daily activities at work. I find that the process I follow to work on cases at my job is highly similar to the flow charts we have been using in this class. My work is dynamic enough to fit very well with this assignment.</p>
<p>The various functions in my code take care of certain tasks that I typically will do when handling my case queue. My procedure function checks if there are cases in the queue. My boolean function determines if all the cases belong in the queue or not. My number function determines the number of cases left over after I work on as many of them as I can. My array function seeks help from my teammates and assigns them the remaining cases. Finally, my string function simply explains which queue I am moving cases to when there are cases that do not belong in my queue.</p>
